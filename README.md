# Short Link
## Url shortener 

## Overwiew
The user inputs a link and has the option to put a preffered name or get a random one generated for them for a shortened version of the link. The user can copy this link as well. 

Followed a tutorial to get familiar with React, Javascript, and HTML. Had to tweak index.js and app.js to support react v6 because tutorial used outdated modules from react v5. 
  
Kept private keys localy for security purposes
